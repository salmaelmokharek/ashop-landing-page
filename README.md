# Description

I use grid and flexbox for responsive layouts, with a minimalist black and white color scheme. 
I prioritize clean typography, rounded design elements, and adaptive breakpoints to create a modern, user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across different devices. 
I focus on creating a visually balanced design that emphasizes simplicity and intuitive user experience.
