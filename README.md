# Description

I utilize grid and flexbox for responsive layouts, featuring a minimalist black and white color scheme. My design prioritizes clean typography, rounded elements, and adaptive breakpoints to ensure a modern, user-friendly interface across all devices. My goal is to achieve a visually balanced design that emphasizes simplicity and an intuitive user experience.
I would like to use the Bootstrap navbar component, but the changes they apply are unnecessary for my needs.
